/*Given an array containing N integers, find length of longest band.
A band is a subsequence which can be reordered in such a manner that all elements appear
consecutive (i.e with absolute difference of 1 neighbouring elements.) 
Longest band is the band (subsequence) which contains maximum integers*/
